<h2>My Name is Naomi</h2>
<p>I'm enjoying Girls Who Code</p>
<p>It could be very hard to get into a program like this.</p>
<p>Becuase it offers so many useful things.</p>
<p>For example, sisterhood that can and will be helpful later on in our life</p>
<p>And for those who will be using the coding later on as well it makes it easier to have in one place</p>
